# Code of Conduct

We want to keep the KubeOrch Community a great place to participate, but we need your help to keep it that way.

The KubeOrch community is made up of a diverse mix of individuals using and contributing to all aspects of the project from all over the world, and we want to make sure that the community is a safe and friendly place for everyone.

As a CNCF-ready project, KubeOrch and its community abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

Should you encounter a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it to the KubeOrch Maintainers private email alias at **maintainers@kubeorch.dev**. If the CoC violation involves a member of the Maintainers, please escalate the report to the [CNCF Conduct staff](https://conduct.cncf.io/). All reports will be kept confidential.
