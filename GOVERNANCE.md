## Maintainers

KubeOrch Maintainers govern the project. Maintainers collectively manage the 
project's resources and contributors, and speak for the project in public. The
maintainers collectively decide any questions that cannot be resolved at the 
individual repository level, and provide strategic guidance for the project
overall.

The current maintainers can be found in [MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/KubeOrch/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers
are people who care about the KubeOrch project and want to help it grow and
improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who
has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most
knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and
follow through to fix issues.

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping
the project succeed.

## Selecting Maintainers

The current project maintainers will periodically review contributor activities
to see if additional project members may be promoted to maintainers.

For nominations, the maintainers will look at the following criteria:

* Commitment to the project: have they participated in discussions, 
  contributions, and reviews for 6 months or more?
* Does the person show leadership in one of these areas?
  * Active approver or reviewer in core repositories
  * Component leadership (frontend, backend, security, etc.)
  * Mentoring other project contributors
  * Community building and outreach
* Does the candidate bring new perspectives or community connections to the 
  maintainers?
* Do they understand how the project works (policies, processes, etc)?
* Are they willing to take on the additional duties of a maintainer?

A candidate must be proposed by an existing maintainer by filing a PR in the
[Community Repository](https://github.com/KubeOrch/community) against the MAINTAINERS.md file. 
A simple majority vote of +1s from existing Maintainers approves the application.

## Meetings

Time zones permitting, Maintainers are expected to participate in the bi-weekly public
community meeting held via GitHub Discussions.

Maintainers will also have closed meetings in order to discuss security reports
or Code of Conduct violations. Such meetings should be scheduled by any
Maintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report. All current Maintainers
must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any Maintainer who is
accused of a CoC violation.

## CNCF Resources

Any Maintainer may suggest a request for CNCF resources in the
[Community Discussions](https://github.com/KubeOrch/community/discussions), 
on GitHub issues, or during a community meeting. A simple majority of Maintainers 
approves the request. The Maintainers may also choose to delegate working with 
the CNCF to non-Maintainer community members.

## Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/KubeOrch/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
violations by community members will be discussed and resolved through private
discussions among maintainers. If the reported CoC violator is a Maintainer, 
the other Maintainers will designate two Maintainers to work with CNCF staff 
in resolving the report.

## Removing Maintainers

Maintainers may voluntarily retire at any time. Should a maintainer retire, 
it requires a majority vote of the current maintainers to reinstate them.

Maintainers may also be demoted at any time for one of the following reasons:

* Inactivity, including 6 months or more of non-participation or non-communication,
* Refusal to abide by this Governance,
* Violations of the Code of Conduct,
* Other actions that harm the reputation, stability, or harmony of the KubeOrch
  project.

Removing a maintainer requires a 2/3 majority vote of the other maintainers.

## Voting

While most business in KubeOrch is conducted by "lazy consensus", periodically
the Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes.
A vote can be taken in [Community Discussions](https://github.com/KubeOrch/community/discussions)
or through private maintainer discussions for security or conduct matters.  
Votes may also be taken at the community meeting. Any Maintainer may
request a vote be taken.

Most votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed. Maintainers
can be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of all Maintainers, and changes to this
Governance require a 2/3 vote of all Maintainers.
